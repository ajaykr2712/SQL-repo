## Introduction

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is used for interacting with databases. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data stored in relational databases. Some common SQL database management systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.

### Why Learn SQL?

- **Data Retrieval:** Extract useful information from large datasets.
- **Data Manipulation:** Modify and update data efficiently.
- **Data Definition:** Define and manage database schemas.
- **Data Control:** Control access to data within the database.

## Basic SQL Commands
### INSERT
The INSERT statement is used to add new rows to a table.

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
VALUES (value1, value2);

### UPDATE
The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table.

sql
Copy code
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;

### DELETE
The DELETE statement is used to remove records from a table.

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

### CREATE TABLE
The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table.

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype PRIMARY KEY,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype
);

### DROP TABLE
The DROP TABLE statement is used to delete a table.

sql
Copy code
DROP TABLE table_name;

## Advanced SQL Concepts
### Joins
SQL joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

#### INNER JOIN
sql
Copy code
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;

### SELECT

The `SELECT` statement is used to query data from a database.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
